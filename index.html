                    Vacation time is upon us! For many of us, that means packing up the car and hitting the open road. But before you embark on your journey, there are a few things you should do to prepare your home. When leaving, you should always think about the other things you did not prepared or settled prior to leaving.
                </p>
                <ol style="padding-left: 25px;">
                    <li>
                        Unplug all unnecessary electronics
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Turn off the water to your home (or at least to any appliances that use water) to avoid any leaks while you’re gone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure all perishable food is either eaten or thrown out
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let a trusted neighbor know you’ll be gone and ask them to keep an eye on your place
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure all doors and windows are locked
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set your alarm
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Put a hold on your mail or have a friend or neighbor pick it up for you while you’re away
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you have pets, make arrangements for someone to take care of them while you’re gone
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Disconnect any automatic payment services that could overdraft your account while you’re away
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Double check that everything is turned off and locked up before leaving on vacation!
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>
                    By taking these simple steps, you can rest assured knowing that your home is safe and sound while you’re away enjoying your well-deserved vacation. Now all that’s left to do is sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride!

                    Make sure all appliances are turned off and unplugged
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the event of a power outage, it is important to make sure all appliances are turned off and unplugged. This includes things like your oven, stovetop, fridge, and even your computer. If these things are left on, they could be damaged when the power comes back on. In some cases, they could even cause a fire. So, it’s better to be safe and just turn everything off. If you have any battery-operated devices, like a flashlight, make sure to keep them handy in case you need them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’ll leave your house for a long  period of time like a vacation trip, it’s important to unplug all appliances as well. This is because if there is a power surge, it could damage your appliances or even start a fire. So, it’s always better to be safe and just turn everything off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s also a good idea to disconnect any electronics that are not being used. For example, if you have a printer that is not in use, you should unplug it. This way, if there is a power surge, it will not damage your electronics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, it’s always best to err on the side of caution when it comes to electricity. If you’re not sure whether or not you should unplug something, it’s better to do so just to be safe. Better safe than sorry!

If you live in an apartment complex, you may also want to call your landlord or the management company. They may have a spare key for your unit that you can use. If you have a home security system, you should also call the monitoring company. They may be able to disable the alarm so that you can enter your home safely. In any case, it’s always best to err on the side of caution and call a professional rather than try to break into your own home.

                <p>
                    Open all of your faucets and flush all of the toilets to empty the lines. Check all of your appliances that use water, such as your washing machine, dishwasher, and ice maker to make sure they are turned off. Once you have verified that all water sources in your house are turned off, open up the main water valve and allow all of the water to drain from your house.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the water has finished draining, close the main water valve and open up all of your faucets again to allow any residual water to drain. Flip all of the switches for your appliances back on, and you should be good to go! If you have any questions or problems, don’t hesitate to contact a professional.

                    Empty your fridge of food and put everything in the freezer

                <p>
                    This will help to preserve your food and keep it from going bad. Plus, it will make it easier to find what you need when you’re looking for something to eat.

                <p>
                    If you have a lot of fresh produce that you need to use up, consider making soup or smoothies. These are both great ways to get all of the nutrients from your food without having to eat it all fresh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don’t forget to label everything so you know what it is and when it was frozen. This will help you keep track of your food and make sure that you’re using it before it goes bad.

                            If you’ve ever lost your car key, you know how frustrating it can be. Hide your car key in a designated spot outside your home, so you don’t lose it when you’re in a hurry. By keeping your car key in the same place every time, you’ll always know where it is when you need it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When choosing a hiding spot, pick somewhere that is easy for you to remember but not obvious to potential thieves. For example, you could hide your car key under a doormat or in a potted plant near the door. If you have an garage, you could also keep your car key in a safe or lockbox inside.
                        </p>

                    Once you’ve chosen a spot, make sure to always put your car key back in the same place. That way, you’ll always know where to find it when you need it.
                </p>

                    If you lose your car key, you can always call a <a href="https://stlocksmith.com/locksmith-house-las-vegas/">locksmith</a> to help you get back into your car. In the meantime, hide your spare car key in a safe place so you don’t have to go through the hassle of losing it again.

                            That way, if you’re ever locked out, they can let you in. If you don’t have anyone you trust nearby, consider joining a neighborhood watch program or keeping your key in a lock box at your home.
